## Design Patterns

- Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. \
- They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. \
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently.

Types of Design Patterns:
1. **Creational** : Creational Design Patterns deals with the process of creation of objects, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
2. **Structural** : Structural Design Patterns deals with how classes and objects are arranged or compose,  while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
3. **Behavioural**: Behavioural Design Pattern describes how classes and objects interact or communicate with each other. \
   Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
